        <h1>Childhood & Early Influences</h1>
        <p class="small">I was born in Mombasa and grewup in multiple places which I have found to be interesting in my life. Circumstances have played part in this and I really can't complain as I have taken everything under my slide.
          Growing up, I was always fascinated by how technology works and how it can be used to solve everyday problems. This curiosity led me to explore various aspects of technology from a young age. 
          I was involved in everything that could be connected from batteries to bulbs to building my own lighting systems especially for my box-made cars which I always found interesting.
        </p>
        <p>As years went by thick and fast, I came to know the world of technology and thats how I decided to venture into the industry. As a first born, my mother has always encouraged me to work hard and build a successful life. She felt proud everytime I made a move forward. I could tell my wins were hers and she was happy for me.</p>

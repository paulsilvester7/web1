<h1>A Tribute to My Mother</h1>
<div class="container">
    
    <div>
        <P>Today, I want to honor the incredible woman who has shaped my life in ways words can hardly express.
            My mother is the embodiment of love, strength, and compassion. Her unwavering support and gentle guidance have been the foundation upon which I build my dreams.
        </P>
    </div>

    <div>
            <p>She has shown me what it means to be resilient in the face of challenges, always standing tall with grace and dignity.
                Her kindness touches everyone around her, and her sacrifices often go unnoticed, yet they are the pillars of my happiness and success.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>To the outside world it feels like you have not done enough, but I know how much effort you have put into raising us.
            Making sure that we are brought up right, with respect and courage to speak out injustices and to have integrity in everything that we do. It's like you always say, "The word is integrity".
                This is the message I assure and promise that I will pass down to my lineage.
        </p>
    </div>

   <div>
        <p>I have learnt lessons from you that I never would have had not had you as my mother.
            But most of all I have learnt how to love, be kind and considerate towards others. Your generosity and compassion and your ability to give of yourself, stands out and I adore you for it.
        </p>

        <h5>Lessons from Mommy:</h5>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Love</li>
                <li>Courage</li>
                <li>Shrewedness</li>
                <li>Caring</li>
            </ol>
        The list is so long that I could fill and entire book and still not exhaust the lessons and discipline you have instilled in me, but these do stand out from the rest.

            The memories I have of you, of us as a family is my treasure chest. I remember the time when you would take us to the beach every weekend and especially on Sundays to make sure we never missed out on anything that would make us enjoy being your children.
                These are what I truly hold dear and cherish.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Thank you, Mom, for your endless patience, your warm embrace, and your unwavering belief in me.
            Your love is a beacon that guides me through every storm. I am forever grateful for your presence in my life, and I cherish every moment spent and continue to spend with you.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>This tribute is a small token of my deep appreciation for the beautiful, strong, and loving mother you are. 
             I love you more than words can say.
        </p>
